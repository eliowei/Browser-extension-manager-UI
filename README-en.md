## Development Process

### Technologies Used

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- TailwindCSS

- SASS

- Flexbox

- CSS Grid

- Responsive Web Design (Mobile, Desktop)

- JavaScript

### Lessons Learned

Through this Frontend Mentor project, I gained hands-on experience with JavaScript and TailwindCSS, especially in implementing responsive design (RWD).

One key takeaway was learning how to implement functionality purely with vanilla JavaScript without using frameworks like Vue. I focused on breaking down the features into smaller parts and implementing them step by step.

### Useful Resources

CSS Tricks - Helped me understand Flexbox layouts.

MDN Web Docs - Provided official documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Frontend Mentor Community - Allowed me to explore solutions from other developers and get inspiration.
